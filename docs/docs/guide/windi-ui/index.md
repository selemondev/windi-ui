# Windi UI

Following Windi UI's goal of speeding up web application development, our next step will be using the existing components to create beautiful and professional looking UIs.

This will allow you as the developer to easily use already made UIs by copying and pasting them in your project. 

We're also working on a feature that will let you add already made UI components through terminal commands, making your work even more efficient.

However, that's just the beginning. As Windi UI **version 0.0.3 Alpha** rolls out, expect the introduction of the **Windi UI CLI**. This tool will enable you to efficiently set up your Windi UI project with sensible configurations, ensuring you're up and running within no time.

Keep an eye for the [Windi UI]() roadmap which is expected to land in [Windi UI](https://github.com/selemondev) **v0.0.1 alpha** which will highlight all the amazing features that will be available within the Windi UI library.
