# Badge

A Badge is used to highlight an item's status for quick recognition.

## Basic Usage

<demo src="../../components/Badge/badgeBasic.vue" />

## Chip

A badge can be used as a chip. You can set the `chip` prop to display a chip as shown below:

<demo src="../../components/Badge/badgeChip.vue" />

## Value

A badge can be used to display a number or string. If the `value` is greater than the `max-value`, the value will be displayed with the `+` icon as shown below:

<demo src="../../components/Badge/badgeValue.vue" />

## Square 

The badge can also be displayed as a square by using the `square` prop as shown below:

<demo src="../../components/Badge/badgeSquare.vue" />

## Position

You can place the badge in different positions by using the `position` prop as shown below:

By default, the chip position is set to `top-right`.
